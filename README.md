# SarradaCounter
Side project just for fun while in class.

How do we survive a class in which the teacher is unbeareble?
Well, we create a software to register the hits he loves to deliver.

This software is written in C and is going to count and register the hits and the targets, as well as the day and exact time.
Feel free to colaborate!
